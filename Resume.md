## PROJECTS

### AWS Scalable Web Architecture (Vocal4Local Migration) § GitHub
> AWS (Route 53, CloudFront, ALB, ASG, RDS Multi-AZ), Terraform, SOPS
- Eliminated 4 critical business risks (downtime, latency, data exposure, traffic surges) by migrating a legacy monolithic application to a 3-tier AWS architecture with Multi-AZ redundancy across 2 Availability Zones and global edge caching.
- Achieved defense-in-depth network security by isolating application and database layers in private subnets behind AWS WAF.
- Improved page load times for international users by serving static assets through CloudFront global edge caching.

### Multi-Cloud Cost Hygiene Automation § GitHub
> LocalStack, Terraform, Python, GitHub Actions, AWS (EC2, EBS, S3, VPC)
- Reduced cloud testing overhead by building a local-first cost detection workflow with LocalStack and Terraform, eliminating the need for real AWS infrastructure during development.
- Reduced risk of orphaned cloud resources by building a Python janitor CLI that detects 3 categories of idle assets (unattached EBS, stopped EC2, unassociated EIPs) with dry-run safety and Protected-tag skip.
- Standardized infrastructure validation across 7 pipeline stages by implementing a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow automating Terraform checks and janitor reporting.

### RankGuard – Async Transaction Processor & Leaderboard § GitHub
> Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.0, Alembic, Docker Compose, pytest
- Guaranteed exactly-once transaction processing across 4 database tables by building an async FastAPI backend with idempotency keys and per-user concurrency locks.
- Enabled multi-factor scoring across 3 transaction types (earn, spend, bonus) by implementing materialized rank computation with atomic SQLAlchemy snapshot updates.
- Streamlined deployment and schema consistency by containerizing with Docker Compose and automating PostgreSQL migrations via Alembic, validated by 8 tests.

### IPL Cricket Data Analytics & Visualization § GitHub
> Python (Pandas), Jupyter Notebook, PowerBI
- Extracted actionable insights from 2 IPL datasets (matches, deliveries) by performing exploratory analysis with Python Pandas across 6 visualization dimensions including team performance and venue trends.
- Enabled data-driven storytelling by building interactive PowerBI dashboards covering season distributions, top performers, and match outcome patterns.
